    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My grandmother's recipe for roasted chicken. I never have had a chicken
      this juicy before; this little trick works and makes the people eating it
      go silent. It's funny. We nibble on the celery after.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
      <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
      <li>Â½ cup margarine, divided</li>
      <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out
          with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. Place
          3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of the
          remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. Cut the celery into
          3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at
          the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An
          instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh,
          near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from
          heat and baste with melted margarine and drippings. Cover with
          aluminum foil and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving.
